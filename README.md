# EIL-Interpreter
This is an Interpreter for the Easily Interpreted Language (EIL) 
This Interpreter uses C++ and was devloped by me with this idea to create a Languge and Interpreter from scratch without looking up how to do it.
EIL documentation is included as well as a document detailing some of my thought processes in the creation of the project
